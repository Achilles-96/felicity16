# Felicity '16

This is the repository for the Felicity '16 website.

In order to build the development environment, do:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run-script gulp
```
> Watch (`gulp-watch`) tasks still have to be written.

Also, you'll need to copy `src/app/config.sample.php` to `src/app/config.php` and edit values.

This repo could still needs a lot of work before it even becomes a good starting point. Please contribute!
